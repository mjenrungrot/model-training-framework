Multi-DataLoader Training Support

This module will provide the multi-dataloader-only training functionality:
- DataLoaderManager for managing multiple dataloaders
- Multi-dataloader iterators with deterministic scheduling
- Sampling strategies (SEQUENTIAL, ROUND_ROBIN, WEIGHTED, ALTERNATING)
- Epoch length policies (SUM_OF_LENGTHS, MAX_OF_LENGTHS, MIN_OF_LENGTHS, FIXED_NUM_STEPS)
- Checkpointable iteration state for fault tolerance
- DDP synchronization support

To be implemented in subsequent PRs.
